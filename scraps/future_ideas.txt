1. use a network (+ pagerank) to address hero pair interactions

2. add more interactions. NLP items and add hero-item interactions

3. figure out other ways to use ratios

4. scrape and incorporate player attitudes: sometimes it takes several patches
   for pro play to accept/catch up to newly strong heroes, but sometimes you
   can see in pro players' comments that they suspect a given hero to be under-
   valued

5. marketplace analogy: heroes -> products, allies -> often bought together,
   counters -> competing products, nerfs/buffs -> price or model changes
